# Persona-Driven Document Intelligence Approach

## Overview
Our solution implements a multi-stage pipeline that combines semantic search with persona-aware summarization to extract the most relevant document sections for specific user roles and tasks.

## Core Methodology

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline
The system processes PDF collections using PyMuPDF for text extraction, implementing parallel processing with ThreadPoolExecutor to handle multiple documents simultaneously. Each page is extracted as a separate text unit, enabling fine-grained relevance scoring.

### 2. Semantic Search Engine
We employ the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 sentence transformer model for generating embeddings. The approach creates persona-specific queries by combining the user role and job-to-be-done into contextual search terms. Cosine similarity scoring identifies the most relevant text sections across all documents.

### 3. Document Diversity Algorithm
To ensure comprehensive coverage, our algorithm implements document-level diversity by selecting the highest-scoring section from each document rather than potentially clustering results from a single source. This guarantees representation across the entire document collection.

### 4. Intelligent Section Title Extraction
The system uses advanced heuristics to identify meaningful section titles, filtering out common non-title patterns (bullet points, page numbers, URLs) while prioritizing properly formatted headers with title case or uppercase formatting.

### 5. Persona-Aware Summarization
Using the T5-small model, we generate contextual summaries by prepending persona information to the text. This ensures summaries are tailored to the specific user role and task requirements, making them more actionable and relevant.

### 6. Performance Optimizations
- **Caching System**: Implements MD5-based caching for embeddings and summaries to avoid redundant computations
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded PDF processing and collection handling
- **Batch Encoding**: Optimized batch sizes for efficient model inference
- **Memory Management**: Proper resource cleanup and text length limitations

## Technical Architecture
The solution maintains CPU-only execution with models under 1GB total size, ensuring compatibility with resource-constrained environments. The modular design separates concerns between text extraction, semantic analysis, and output generation, enabling easy maintenance and testing.

## Quality Assurance
The system implements comprehensive error handling, logging, and fallback mechanisms to ensure robust operation across diverse document types and content structures while maintaining consistent output format compliance.
